 * the nonce to. `options.verify` checks the exchanged token and throws to refuse it.
 *
 * The browser's request for the redirect is answered only after the code exchange and `verify`,
 * so it never shows "Signed in" for a token this flow goes on to refuse. (Saving the credential
 * comes later, in `runLogin`; a store that then refuses the write is reported in the terminal.)
